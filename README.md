## Overview

This Music Player Web App allows you to play music, view track information, and manage a playlist. It comes with a customizable ticker message and an interactive progress bar.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for local development)
- A modern web browser

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-player-web-app.git
cd music-player-web-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

*Note: If your project doesn’t use any Node.js dependencies, you can skip this step.*

### 3. Configure Your Tracks

Open the `js/config.js` file and add your track information. Here’s an example configuration:

```javascript
// config.js

const config = {
    tickerMessage: "Now Playing: Tune In for More Music!", // Edit your ticker message
    albumCoverImage: "images/cover.png", // Path to your album cover image

    // Example track list; users can customize this with their own tracks
    trackList: [
        { name: "Pure Souls", artist: "Kanye West, Roddy Ricch", src: "music/puresouls.mp3" }
        // Add more tracks as needed
    ]
};
```

Replace `images/cover.png` and `music/puresouls.mp3` with paths to your own image and music files.

## Usage

### 1. Starting the Application

To start the application, simply open `index.html` in a web browser. If you are using a local development server, make sure to start it by running:

```bash
npm start
```

### 2. Customizing Your Music Player

You can customize the appearance and functionality of the music player by editing the `styles.css` and `config.js` files.

**CSS Customization:**

Edit `css/styles.css` to change the look and feel of your music player.

**JavaScript Configuration:**

Update `js/config.js` with your preferred track list and ticker message.
